Recently, I've met some software companies where, even in the very early stages with fewer than 8 in the only backend team, they have opted to separate the functions of infrastructure from the general development.

This separation has led to the establishment of an SRE/Infra/Platform Team focused on long-term planning. Despite consisting of only 1 or 2 members, this team operates as an independent entity.

Initially, I found this setup quite intriguing. Could a team of this size benefit from such a structure? However, I quickly observed the advantages brought about by this organizational arrangement.

Long-term engineering planning typically involves addressing important but non-urgent issues that require sustained investment to make progress and ensure the right direction.

As a system matures or reaches a certain scale, there usually arises a need to improve the overall architecture. Without an independent unit, these improvements would compete for resources alongside other incoming development needs, often resulting in significant compromises.

It sounds reasonable for engineers with the same job title within the same team to prioritize projects in the same order of importance, as well as coordinate support for each other's projects.

However, even if EMs intend to have several members focus solely on long-term planning, it's challenging to continuously refuse context-switching in the face of a constant stream of demands.

This situation could even damage their credits if not communicated properly.

In contrast, the independent Platform Team can legitimately address this issue.

With a distinct recruitment process, reporting line, and higher cross-team mobility threshold, it becomes more feasible to keep investing in necessary long-term planning steadily.

Moreover, forming dedicated teams demonstrates the company's tangible commitment to software sustainability.

Even if there is only 1 person, it's evident that issues are included in the planning and updated regularly.

This approach is far preferable to constantly postponing improvements due to continual diversions, as many technical debts become almost irreversible once they reach a critical point.

Overall, I believe it's a commendable approach to address resource allocation issues via organizational development. This approach should not be specific to software engineering; other functions may suffer from similar problems from prioritization and context-switching.
