Influencing organizations and products is always a popular topic in everyone's daily workplace and career, especially in a large-scale firm or a complicated business.

Unlike the feature requests or bug fixes, influencing has no specific directions, all we can rely on is usually a vague high-level objective, or even just an intuition that something needs to be improved.

Leveraging is not only an exciting challenge in personal growth, also one of the keys to contribute to the growth of the team, promote virtuous circles and achieve excellence in the long-term.

As relatively experienced members, we will often be expected to share the responsibilities, carry out practical strategies and drive the solutions.

Below are some approaches from my experience while working as a Sr. SWE at Appier, hope these give you some inspiration :)


# Remove the Critical Blockers

The day-to-day life of a software engineering team is not always smooth sailing. More precisely, we will encounter bottlenecks every now and then, not all of them are technical related, tight schedule and legacy architecture accounted for a large proportion.

Countless components and logics intertwined with each other, we proceed cautiously, bypass the fragile parts and keep away from the magics which we do not familiar enough with.

Identifying and removing the critical blockers that the team greatly constrained by or suffer from often ameliorate team-wide workflow and decisions.

Including but not limited to:

- Make everyone can deploy the specific version of service with just one click by establishing an artifacts management system and general deployment process.

- Make more modern classes and functions available to everyone by upgrading the deeply-adopted web framework.

- Make everyone can clarify the root cause of the error without studying the logs and records inside the database by integrating observability tools to expose the status and result of async tasks.

- Let everyone no longer need to waste time typing example inputs manually by designing the sample data generating tool.

The nature of the team-wide capacity is continuous and stable like a river, but it may take a turn while encountering obstacles like rocks, while the individuals is often more domain-specific and targeted.

In order to get the team on the right track, timely guide the way forward of the organization via outstanding personal skills well worth a try.


# Mentoring & Sponsoring

# Earn the Credits

# Establish Standards for Reference

Unfortunately, we can not adopt workarounds all the way, every anti-pattern and non-best-practice are increasing the organization's debt.
