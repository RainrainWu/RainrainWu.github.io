                <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, in many business models, product or service stability is an essential element and often the key factor in determining customer retention and company revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-call rotation is a widely used and proven practice, but it is also a major contributor to the erosion of work-life balance. While it may seem like a necessary decision, there are many details that should be considered, as cultural differences can often leave a lasting impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series of articles will cover several interesting topics. These topics are not only indicators used by myself to evaluate the engineering culture of other teams during interviews, but also ways to drive progress within each team when I have greater impact in future careers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
