[{"categories":["negotiation"],"content":"Conflict is an almost inevitable problem in one’s career. It often ended up feeling embarrassed or chose to keep the grievances to ourselves when dealing with it the first few time. However, looking back now, those seemingly catastrophic dilemmas did not necessarily end in tragedy.\nAfter practicing ‘Collaborative Negotiation’ in various scenarios such as interviews, project scheduling, and problem clarification over the past few years, I have fugured out an approach for myself that is both emotionally acceptable and delivers mostly favorable outcomes.\nHere are some relatively specific and practical skills to share:\nRather than directly opposing issues, focus on and gradually expand areas of common ground While it is natural to invest energy in issues that one cares about, it can be challenging to make progress when directly opposing the other side. In situations where obstacles seem insurmountable, considering alternative routes can also be an option.\nFor instance, when discussing a project with a tight schedule, proposing a delay in the delivery time can encounter great resistance. However, there might be a shared understanding that the situation must be mitigated on time.\nBased on this unspoken agreement, the focus can be shifted to other aspects such as delivery quality or scale instead of just the schedule.\nRaise the level of discussion by continuously tracing back to the root of the problem Negotiations that are difficult to progress may be due to strict constraints within the framework. For example, the conversation can become stuck in a tug of war over the specific number after being asked about the current or expected basic salary.\nWhile the basic salary is undoubtedly significant, it is only one aspect of the compensation package, and the current package structure is just one piece of information disclosed during the recruitment process. Therefore, it might be beneficial to elevate the discussion by delving into the whole compensation package structure or even the entire recruitment policy.\nThe core issue should be focused on making the recruitment process successful, rather than merely convincing the candidate to accept a specific number mentioned in a half-hour video call.\nWhat other action can be took to make the recruitment successful, considering the current policies and procedures? This might involve offering sign-on bonuses, additional PTO, submitting recommendation letters from former managers, or professional certificates for re-evaluation.\nBy elevating the discussion and reframing the problem, there may be opportunities to discover new possibilities for collaboration.\nClarify the goals and limitations of both sides and collaborate to find a solution Breaking the deadlock can also be achieved by sincerely asking the other side about their current considerations or limitations. This can help establish a shared perspective and clarify the goals of both sides. By engaging in candid communication, you can work together towards finding a mutually beneficial solution.\nMost of the time, nothing will be changed whether we choose to be transparent or withhold information. However, a desirable outcome can be achieved by exchanging ideas and arriving at a feasible solution.\nThe inclination to withhold information is primarily a matter of perception, but with enough work experience, many things become common knowledge, and we may even laugh it off if we choose to be transparent.\nUntangling the underlying logic of restrictions during negotiations and searching for details that provide a turning point or a reason for making an exception can be worthwhile and may lead to finding a solution that was not initially apparent.\nInvite the other side to participate in “Collaborative Negotiation” I personally think that one of the core concepts of “cooperative negotiation” is to share information. If both parties are willing to invest, it can save a lot of mental costs of being suspicious, and there is a considerable improvement in the efficiency of progress.\nThe last technique I want to share is to demonstrate the efficiency and results to the other side, encourage them to share more information, and work together towards achieving common goals.\nBy doing so, you can foster a sense of cooperation and establish a shared perspective, leading to a more successful negotiation outcome.\n","description":"","tags":["career","negotiation","team"],"title":"Collaborative Negotiation","uri":"/posts/collaborative_negotiation/"},{"categories":["engineering"],"content":"Today, in many business models, product or service stability is an essential element and often the key factor in determining customer retention and company revenue.\nOn-call rotation is a widely used and proven practice, but it is also a major contributor to the erosion of work-life balance. While it may seem like a necessary decision, there are many details that should be considered, as cultural differences can often leave a lasting impact.\nThis series of articles will cover several interesting topics. These topics are not only indicators used by myself to evaluate the engineering culture of other teams during interviews, but also ways to drive progress within each team when I have greater impact in future careers.\nHow companies Treat On Call Rotation The management’s stance on an issue can be considered the starting point for everything. It determines the allocation of resources and the level of humanization in the system and processes.\nWhile software products cannot be perfect and accidents may occur after going online, this does not mean that having engineers on-call is a one-time solution. Turning a blind eye to problems after implementing an on-call system is the worst strategy.\nHowever, these are abstract concepts that can be challenging to make progress on when raised within an organization. Additionally, the other party may whitewash such sensitive issues during an interview. To provide more concrete examples, I have outlined a few specific issues below for reference.\nSupporting measures such as shift scheduling mechanism, SOP, accident classification, etc. These various supporting measures exist to make on-call rotations more efficient and humane. I have personally experienced a significant difference early in their career based on the presence of such measures, and has since placed great importance on this aspect of the culture.\nFor example, when national holidays is coming and no one is willing to be on-call, there are specific issues to consider such as whether there is a maintenance SOP document to follow or if an accident requires immediate attention. These factors have a significant impact on daily work.\nThese measures reveal whether a company is willing to invest resources to alleviate the pressure on frontline personnel and minimize the frequency of disrupting employees during non-working hours.\nTrying to prevent the same problem from happening again and again. No one wants to be called back to work during non-working hours. However, if an incident occurs that affects someone’s life, efforts should be made to prevent it from happening again in the future.\nWhile not all problems can be fundamentally solved, many can be mitigated through techniques such as automatic retry when encountering errors in network requests or implementing new technologies that allow for failover.\nIf a large number of problems continue to occur without mitigation, it may indicate that On Call is being used as a long-term solution rather than a short-term emergency measure. This can lead to increased pressure on the team.\nWillingness to compensate those affected Compensation means recognizing the impact on an employee’s life caused by On Call responsibilities and being willing to communicate constructively. Having corresponding compensation rules is a positive signal, especially when compared to organizations that believe engineers should solely be responsible for the normal operation of the system.\nThe most common compensation methods are compensatory time off and overtime pay, each with its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the team and individual circumstances.\nFor instance, requesting compensatory leave in a short period of time when the workload is heavy can be difficult, and overtime pay is not advantageous for employees with low basic salaries. The relatively low overtime pay can lead to situations where the normal limit exceeds the legal limit.\nClarifying ambiguities or exceptions to the rules can help to obtain more practical information, reduce information gaps, and align mutual expectations within the organization.\nThis time, we have discussed how the organizational culture reflected in On Call Rotation through some specific questions. This can serve as a reference for evaluating the culture of a new team or promoting improvements in the current organization.\nWhile many companies may not be able to provide a more humane On Call system due to limited resources or the nature of their product, readers are encouraged to think about how to have a constructive discussion after raising concerns. After all, there should always be someone who fights for the opportunity to bring about change.\nThe following articles will take a pragmatic approach to the daily life of software engineering teams. They will analyze the root causes of problems and discuss the harm they can cause to an organization.\n","description":"","tags":["engineering","product","team"],"title":"A Necessary Evil : On Call Rotation (I)","uri":"/posts/on-call-rotation-01/"}]
